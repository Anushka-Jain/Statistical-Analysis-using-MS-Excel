In recent years, Ireland's minimum wage and per capita income have risen. In the context of rising overall per capita income, we wanted to investigate average earnings for various types of employees in various economic sectors and identify differences in salary levels across sectors. Each economic sector in the data set is divided into All NACE economic sectors excluding activities A, T, and U (B to S), Business and services (B to N, R, S), Industry (B to E), and Public administration, education, and health, while employees are divided into three types of employees: Production, transport, craft, and other manual workers, Clerical, sales, and service employees, and Managers, professionals, and associated professionals. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are our main statistical methods. We use descriptive statistics to describe the estimates of average of earnings of employees in the sample data and use inferential analysis to determine whether the earning of employees in different Sectors are equal. The final research results show that the earning of employees in different departments are not equal. The average earning level of Industry employees is higher. The average earning of employee in Public Administration, education and health sector are generally lower.
